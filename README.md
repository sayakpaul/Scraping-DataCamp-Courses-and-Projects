Gathering data is a crucial step in cases where you don't have data the ready for the problem statement. There are several methods for 
effective data collection. _Web scrapping_ is just one of them. 

This repository contains code from my web scrapping practice sessions. Also, for being closely associated with DataCamp, I get questions like - 'Hey, can I get a list of the courses and projects offered by DataCamp?' This little project might come in handy there.
